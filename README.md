## Operating Systems - Universitat Pompeu Fabra

This repository contains my group deliverables for the **Operating Systems** course, a second-year subject in the Bachelor's degree on *Mathematical Engineering on Data Science* at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona (2024).

### Project Details

This repository contains the group lab deliverables, developed with my partner **Júlia López**. Each lab focused on specific aspects of concurrency and process management, with provided frameworks to guide the code modifications in **C**. Below is a summary of the main labs:

- **Lab 1**: We implemented a command-line utility for generating and verifying CRC codes of a file, ensuring data integrity.

- **Lab 3**: The goal was to parallelize the CRC verification process for multiple files using threads. In this lab, we synchronized file access with semaphores and locks to prevent data races and implemented a `FileManager` structure to manage file descriptors, statuses, and availability for each thread.

- **Lab 5**: We implemented inter-process communication using pipes for concurrent CRC processing.
